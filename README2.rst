A website that helps you visualize your personality using graphs and compare it 
with others. It asks you a
series of questions and analyzes your inputs to create an easy to understand 
graph. It also provides you an
easy way to share these results with your peers and compare your personalities.
It is based on the 
OCEAN_ personality model which is the most acceptable model to measure 
personality used by researchers.
